Behind the Scenes of Stardom: Decoding the Patterns in Actors' Careers
How do you envision your career? We, as scientists, will probably spend a substantial portion of our career in the same company in a specific field, like pharma, robotics or data science for the most talented of us. For actors, the journey is more complex, involving potential shifts between diverse movie genres and marked by the inevitable highs and lows inherent to the profession. In our project, we aim at analyzing the trajectory of acting careers. 
Usually, when you seek information about someone's career, you turn to LinkedIn. Would you do the same to stalk your childhood actor crush? Well, good news, we are here to do it for you.
